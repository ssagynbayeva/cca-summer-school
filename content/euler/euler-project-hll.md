# HLL Riemann solver

We solved the Riemann problem for the Euler equations exactly, but
many times in practice we use approximate Riemann solvers.  The HLL
solver is a popular solver.  Research this method and implement it in
the Euler code and compare the solutions you get with it to those with
the exact solver.
