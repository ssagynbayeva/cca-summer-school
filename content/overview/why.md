# Why Write Your Own Hydro Code?

There are *a lot* of simulation codes developed by the astro community
that are freely available (and you are hearing about some during this
school).

So why should you write your own?

## It's difficult to completely document a code in a paper

## There are lots of subtleties

## There are strengths / tradeoffs that need to be made along the way

## Eventually you'll want new features

## Our community continually needs new developers
