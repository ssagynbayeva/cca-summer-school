This is a collection of notebooks on writing a simple finite-volume
solver for compressible hydrodynamics.


.. tip::

   Detailed derivations of the methods described here can be found in my LaTeX notes
   `Introduction to Computational Astrophysical Hydrodynamics <http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/hydro_by_example/CompHydroTutorial.pdf>`_
